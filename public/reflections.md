# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with three to five sentences.
* Evaluating Boolean Expressions - At first, this topic was a little bit confusing. However, the examples made it stick eventually. It's all about knowing what each operator does, and all the special falsy values.
* HTML Elements - These are the building blocks of a basic website. These include paragraph texts, headers, images, links, buttons, and many more. We did this a lot in the first half of the quarter/
* Basic DOM - It is possible to combine Javascript functionalities with HTML content. With it, you can detect certain events, like a button press or hover. Then, you can dynamically change that content with JS code.
* Conditional Statements - The main example of a conditional statement is the if-else statement. In it, you check conditions that can lead to different pathways of outputs. This allows you to change the action or output of the program based on different inputs or conditions. Another example of a conditional statement is the switch statement.
* Setting GitHub and VSCode - These are the 2 main tools we used in this subject. Github is our platform to save all related files to the CS subject. VSCode is an IDE that allows to access those Github repos and work on them with ease.

# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
* Evaluating Javascript Operations -I'm able to get the basic rules of the operations. However, I can still get confused by specific examples in this topic.
* Loops - I still need to work on interpreting loops faster, especially for nested loops.
* CSS - I'm still not that good at designing things with CSS, so that's something I'll have to practice.
* N/A - I can't really think of other topics that I still need extra help wiith. The curriculum so far has been taught really well :)

# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
Practice is probably the only way I will get better at these things. With the vast amount fo resources online, it shouldn't hard to find good starting points. Using these concepts more will help me ingrain them in my mind. 

# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
* Independent Exercises (Resources from Gspace, Khub) - I prefer this method of learning new CS concepts
* Collabarative Sessions in class - It's very useful to help and be helped by each other :)
* Live Code Demos - I think if it's done too fast, we get overwhelmed and not really learn anything
* Coding on Paper - It's honestly the same thing for me as coding on a computer (meaning, I process and analyze code logic the same regardless of the medium), but it takes longer to write the code.
