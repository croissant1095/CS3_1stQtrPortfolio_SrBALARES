## Take on SONA 2025
## By: Ryan Gavin Balares, 9-Strontium

# Some Interesting Points:
1. Marcos reiterated his 2022 campaign promise to bring down the price of rice to 20 pesos per kilo. While there are now rollouts of this program, it really shouldn't have been a promise 3 years ago, in my opinion.
2. Marcos also spent some time talking about PhilHealth and its coverage on diseases and surgeries. I'm interested to see where this goes.
3. Marcos also briefly talked about the mental health of the youth (in conjunction to bullying and depression). While there have been efforts to prioritize student mental health, the problem is that mental health in the Philippines is really stigmatized. A lot from older generations would call us "soft" for having mental health issues, not helping the problems at all, and creating a rift between the young and old generations.

# A Weird Point (or lack thereof...)
- Recently, Bongbong Marcos made a visit to the United States of America to have talks with US President Donald Trump. They reached an agreement: decrease the US tariff on Philippine exports imported into the US, and place no tariffs on certain US products (like automobiles). 
- However, it was never talked about in actual SONA.

# State of the Nation
The political climate of the Philippines has really evolved over the last 3 years. Marcos and Duterte were once fierce allies, promising many things in their election campaign, with some coming through, others not really. Since their election, many things have changed. From the doubters against Marcos (questioning his capability as a president), the sudden rift between the president and vice-president (with her impeachment controversies and arrest of her father), and the 2025 midterms, the state of this nation really does seem uncertain right now.

This administration has 3 more years to fulfill their promises and prepare the slate for the next president. From the more conservative old demographic of the nation, to the more "woke" youth movements, I've seen how the different ideologies of people in this country have clashed. Where this nation goes 10 years from now really hangs in who the next president is. Many of the recent events by politicians have been done with a motive, to support or bring down an official (like the case of Sara Duterte).

# Synthesis
People of the nation, will your ideas and officials you support **really** take this country forward...
